# W창bi

**This page is currently under construction**

W창bi is a CC(0) comics I do in my spare time. If you want to help, feel free to contribute (or fork it, or whatever you want).
I don't care what you do with the files in this repository, but it's cool if you send me a message.

# Structure

This repository contains some directories:

+ `scenarios`: The full story of `W창bi` is in this directory. If you want to discover the final story, **DO NOT ENTER IN THIS FOLDER**.
+ `src`: All source files of the comics is in this directory. You will see everything I have for each pages. Note: `src` contains screenshots from non free videos.
+ `W창bi`: The final comic is here.

# Contribute

You can contribute by different ways:
+ Translate the comics (I don't know the best way to do that for now)
+ Fix typos. I am not a native speaker, I can do mistakes.
+ Improve the scenario (but not re-write it). Note: if you want to do a whole new story, please create your own repository. I want to do mine.
+ Add colors! Please ask me if you want to do that. A color means something. I already know the main color for each part.
+ Re-draw the whole scenario. We can do the same story several times, with different styles.
+ Note 2: If you want to do the same repository concept, but with a different scenario. Please do your own repo :)
